Definition :

“The Facade Design Pattern is a structural pattern that provides a simplified, unified interface to a complex subsystem. It hides the complexities of the system and makes it easier for clients to use.”

👉 In short: it’s like a front desk at a hotel — instead of dealing with housekeeping, kitchen, and reservations separately, you just call the reception (facade).
